    TODO:

    Mimic generation and interpretation for each instruction. more similar t
   interpretation, this should yield a function to call to pass typecheck
   information to and args so these things can check all types symbols its
   functionally almost the same as interpretation but instead of DOING the thing
   at each stage we VALIDATE the thing by ensuring parameters and types of
   symbols are all solid

    the current TCS does this, but this implementation will be used along-side
   its replacement to fulfill the TCS functionality
