=== DATA INTEGRITY VERIFICATION TEST ===
This test stores values and uses them in operations to verify correctness

--- Integer Integrity: Store 100, retrieve, add 50 ---
Result: 150 (expected 150)

--- Real Integrity: Store 2.5, retrieve, multiply by 4.0 ---
Result: 10.000000 (expected 10.0)

--- String Integrity: Store and compare length/content ---
Retrieved: test123 (expected test123)

--- Multi-Store Test: Store 3 numbers, retrieve all, verify ---
Sum of 10+20+30 = 60 (expected 60)

--- Overwrite Test: Store 100, overwrite with 200, verify ---
After overwrite: 200 (expected 200)

--- Cross-Type Test: Store int, real, string independently ---
Int: 42, Real: 3.140000, String: hello

=== INTEGRITY VERIFICATION COMPLETE ===
If all values match expected, serialization is working correctly!
