# AI Usage 

I had an AI generate each of these (GPT5.1) individually then I had another AI (sonnet 4.5) validate them.
For the most part they did okay, but then I spent a solid hour our so going through them and found a ton of bugs.
I took my revision notes back to claude and had him recorrect each doc. I then went back over them all briefly.
The docs here are better put together and more expansive than I would have made on my own and are pretty great.

I don't let AI do work in my code aside from refactors and auto completes so I was hesitant to permit it on docs but it
appears that if you aren't too lazy about it they can be a real help.
