    ; load loads the kernel, load can take any number of strings, but they must be string type 
    #(load "io") ; system will attempt to use this string as an absolute path to a kernel file, if not, tthen it will search all include paths for "path/io/kernel.sxs"

    ; give symbol for import to load into, give absolute file path or
    ; name that can be found include_dir/file_name.sxs
    ; then will load symbol into main interpreter as test_import
    #(import test_import "kernel_test_import_file.sxs")


    ; Once the kernel is loaded, we can use the functions defined in it

    ; We must restrict #(load-kernel) commands to ONLY be permitted as the first commands in the scriot.
    ; 

    ; Since we are going to add "export" command, this will take the symbol
    ; and oject created and add to an export map. once we close out the import
    ; interpreter we will use this map to dump symbols into the main scope
    ; as "symbol / "exported_symbol"
    ; so in our case "test_import / some_function"
    ;
    ; note: we will need a means to indicate if a symbol is mutable or not
    ; lets start off with all symbols as immutable.
    ; then, later we can add a special command to make mutable variables.
    ; we can dicatete that all imported and "set" symbols are immutable.
